# jaxFlowSim
This code was written during the course of the thesis "On differentiable simulations of haemodynamic systems" and the corresponding document can be found at github.com/DiegoRenner/On-fast-simulations-of-cardiac-function. It offers the ability to parse models, run models, and infer parameters.

## Parsing
The parsing scripts can be found in the _parsing_ folder. Models can be parsed from two different formats. The first format being models provided by _vascularmodel.com_. In order to parse these kinds of models the files representing a 3D-model from _vascularmodel.com_ needs to be placed in the parsing folder. Furthermore an encoding of the network structure done by centre-line extraction needs to be placed in the model folder as well. This network structure can be generated using the _Slicer 3D_ software. In order to parse a _vascularmodel_ network, once the files have been placed appropriately, run
```
python parse_vm.py <model_name>.
```
The second format that can be parsed is the format used in the openBF-hub repository _github.com/alemelis/openBF-hub_. In order to parse these models the repository need to be cloned in to the _parsing_ folder. Then the models can be parsed by running

```
python parse_bf.py <model_name> <model_sub_dir>}
```
where depending on the model the _model\_sub\_dir_ argument might not be relevant. The parsed models are all stored in the _test_ folder.

## Running Models
The parsed models can be run by executing the following command in the base directory of the _jaxFlowSim_ repository

```
python run_model.py <model_name>.
```
The results of a successfully simulated model can be found in the folder _results/<model\_name>_.

## Parameter Inference
Parameter inference can be run by executing
```
python run_inference.py <model_name>
```
in the base directory as well. We note that the inferring of a parameter in this manner is very experimental and requires that the user hand tunes the file _src/inference.py_. However by running 

```
python run_inference.py 
```

without an argument the toy problem from the last section of the results chapter in _github.com/DiegoRenner/On-fast-simulations-of-cardiac-function_ can be computed.
